This performance of the NER model is perfect, since precision, recall, and F1 values are 1.0000. 
Precision with this value means all of the predicted entities were correct, while recall means that 
the model found all actual entities in the text. The F1 score, being a balance of precision and recall,
also being 1.0000, does demonstrate perfect performance. It means that the model found all the entities
without making any mistakes, neither missing nor labeling it as another one. In any case, these results 
in this dataset need further testing for being extended to a more general assessment.
